JavaScript is a **high-level, interpreted, scripting language** that was originally designed for client-side web development. This means it runs directly in the browser 
and allows websites to be **interactive and dynamic**, such as updating content without reloading the page or responding to user actions like clicks and keyboard input.
For example:

```javascript
document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", () => {
    alert("Button clicked!");
});
```

One of the unique features of JavaScript is that it is a **prototype-based language**. Unlike languages like C++ or Java, where objects are created from **classes**, 
in JavaScript objects can inherit directly from other objects. This allows for flexible and dynamic inheritance. For example:

```javascript
const animal = {
    speak() {
        console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
    }
};

const dog = Object.create(animal);
dog.name = "Rex";
dog.speak();  // Output: Rex makes a sound.
```

Here, `dog` inherits the `speak` method directly from `animal`, without needing a formal class structure.

JavaScript’s **syntax is heavily influenced by C++ and Java**, making it easier for programmers familiar with these languages to learn it. However, with the advent of 
**Node.js**, JavaScript is no longer limited to the browser—it can now be used for **backend development** and creating **APIs**, enabling full-stack development with a 
single language.

In **2015**, ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced the **class syntax** to JavaScript to make code cleaner and easier to read, especially for developers coming from class-based 
languages. It provides a familiar structure for defining objects and inheritance, but under the hood, JavaScript still uses **prototypes**:

```javascript
class Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    speak() {
        console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    speak() {
        console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
    }
}

const rex = new Dog("Rex");
rex.speak();  // Output: Rex barks.
```

In this example, `Dog` extends `Animal`, giving the appearance of class-based inheritance, but JavaScript is still internally using prototypes to link objects. 
This combination of simplicity, flexibility, and modern features makes JavaScript one of the most widely used languages today, both on the **frontend** and **backend**.
